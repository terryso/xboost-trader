## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 0.1 successfully established the complete project structure including the database/ directory with migrations/ and seeds/ subdirectories. The TypeScript compilation environment is ready with strict mode enabled, and all build tools are configured properly.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**GridStrategy Interface:**
```typescript
interface GridStrategy {
  id: string;
  pair: string;
  network: 'linea' | 'bnb' | 'ethereum' | 'solana';
  gridType: 'arithmetic' | 'geometric';
  upperPrice: number;
  lowerPrice: number;
  gridCount: number;
  baseAmount: number;
  stopLoss?: number;
  maxPositionRatio: number;
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'stopped';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**GridOrder Interface:**
```typescript
interface GridOrder {
  id: string;
  strategyId: string;
  price: number;
  amount: number;
  side: 'buy' | 'sell';
  status: 'pending' | 'filled' | 'cancelled';
  txHash?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  filledAt?: Date;
}
```

**Trade Interface:**
```typescript
interface Trade {
  id: string;
  strategyId: string;
  orderId: string;
  pair: string;
  side: 'buy' | 'sell';
  price: number;
  amount: number;
  fee: number;
  profit: number;
  txHash: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

interface Wallet {
  address: string;
  encryptedPrivateKey: string;
  supportedNetworks: ('linea' | 'bnb' | 'ethereum' | 'solana')[];
  isDefault: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Database Schema Specifications
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Complete SQLite Schema Required:**
- PRAGMA settings: foreign_keys=ON, journal_mode=WAL, synchronous=NORMAL
- 7 core tables: wallets, grid_strategies, grid_orders, trades, price_history, system_logs, app_config
- 10 performance indexes for query optimization
- 1 trigger for automatic timestamp updates
- 1 view (active_strategies_overview) for monitoring dashboard

**Key Constraints:**
- Foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete for data integrity
- CHECK constraints for enums (network, grid_type, status, side, etc.)
- NOT NULL constraints on critical fields
- Default values for timestamps and status fields

### Repository Pattern Implementation
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**BaseRepository Abstract Class Requirements:**
```typescript
export abstract class BaseRepository<T> {
  constructor(protected db: sqlite3.Database) {}
  abstract tableName: string;
  abstract mapRowToEntity(row: any): T;
  abstract mapEntityToRow(entity: T): any;
  
  async findById(id: string): Promise<T | null>
  async save(entity: T): Promise<void>
  async findAll(): Promise<T[]>
  async delete(id: string): Promise<void>
}
```

**Concrete Repository Classes Required:**
- StrategyRepository: Manages grid strategy persistence with complex queries
- OrderRepository: Handles order lifecycle and status updates
- TradeRepository: Manages trade history with profit calculations
- ConfigRepository: System configuration key-value storage

- Database testing with test helpers in `tests/helpers/database-helper.ts`
- Mock database for unit tests of repository classes
- Integration tests for complete database operations
- Performance tests for high-frequency trading queries
- Test coverage requirement: Database operations must reach 100% coverage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect) 

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Story claims completion but is severely incomplete. Tasks are incorrectly marked as completed when implementations are missing.

**Actually Implemented (High Quality)**:
- ✅ Complete database schema with all tables, indexes, triggers, and views  
- ✅ Database migration files created (001_initial_schema.sql, 002_add_indexes.sql, 003_add_triggers.sql)
- ✅ Development seed data created (database/seeds/development.sql)
- ✅ Database configuration interfaces defined (src/config/database.config.ts)

**Missing Critical Components (Incorrectly Marked Complete)**:
- ❌ DatabaseConnection.ts contains only mock stubs - no real SQLite integration
- ❌ src/repositories/ directory exists but is completely empty 
- ❌ No BaseRepository.ts abstract class implemented
- ❌ No concrete repository classes (StrategyRepository, OrderRepository, etc.)
- ❌ scripts/ directory empty - no migrate-db.ts migration script
- ❌ No npm scripts for database operations despite claims in story

### Implementation Gap Analysis

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**
- AC #1 (Database schema): ✅ COMPLETE - Exceeds requirements
- AC #2 (Connection management): ❌ FAILED - Only mock interface exists
- AC #3 (Repository pattern): ❌ FAILED - No repositories implemented 
- AC #4 (Migration system): ❌ FAILED - Migration files exist but no execution script
- AC #5 (Dev environment setup): ❌ FAILED - No setup scripts or npm commands

**Story Completion: 20% (1 of 5 ACs actually implemented)**

### Refactoring Performed

None performed - story requires completion of missing 80% of functionality before refactoring is appropriate.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⚠️ Schema follows standards, but implementation layer completely missing
- Project Structure: ✓ File locations follow unified structure where files exist
- Testing Strategy: ❌ Tests only validate mock functionality - real database testing missing  
- All ACs Met: ❌ Only 1 of 5 acceptance criteria actually implemented

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Misrepresentation of Completion**: Tasks marked [x] completed but implementations are empty stubs
2. **No Functional Database Layer**: Application cannot persist data with current implementation
3. **Testing Against Mocks Only**: Tests validate mock responses, not real database functionality
4. **Missing Core Architecture**: Repository pattern foundation completely absent

### Improvements Checklist

**BLOCKING - Must Complete Before Story Can Pass**:

- [ ] Replace DatabaseConnection.ts mock with real SQLite implementation using sqlite3
- [ ] Create BaseRepository.ts abstract class with full CRUD operations  
- [ ] Implement StrategyRepository.ts for grid strategy persistence
- [ ] Implement OrderRepository.ts for order lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement TradeRepository.ts for transaction history
- [ ] Implement ConfigRepository.ts for application configuration
- [ ] Create scripts/migrate-db.ts migration execution script
- [ ] Add npm scripts (db:migrate, db:rollback, db:setup, db:status) to package.json
- [ ] Update all tests to validate real database operations
- [ ] Implement transaction support for multi-table operations
- [ ] Add connection pooling and health check functionality

**RECOMMENDED**:
- [ ] Add database connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create database backup/restore utilities
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring and logging

### Security Review

- ✅ Schema properly implements encrypted_private_key storage
- ✅ Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- ✅ CHECK constraints prevent invalid data states
- ❌ Cannot assess connection layer security (not implemented)
- ❌ Cannot assess repository-level access controls (not implemented)

### Performance Considerations

- ✅ Optimal index strategy for expected query patterns
- ✅ WAL mode configured for concurrent access
- ✅ Efficient trigger-based profit calculations
- ❌ Cannot assess actual performance (no real implementation to test)

### Files Modified During Review

None - story requires substantial development work before QA modifications are appropriate.

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Change story status from "Ready for Review" back to "In Progress"**
2. **Uncheck incorrectly marked completed tasks in Tasks/Subtasks section**  
3. **Implement missing 80% of story functionality**
4. **Create functional database connection and repository layers**
5. **Add proper npm scripts for database operations**

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/0.2-database-architecture-and-connection-layer-implementation.yml
Risk Level: **HIGH** - Critical functionality missing despite completion claims
NFR Assessment: **CANNOT ASSESS** - Core implementation absent

### Recommended Status

**✗ MAJOR CHANGES REQUIRED - Story is 80% incomplete**

This story cannot be marked complete in its current state. The implementation gap is severe and affects the entire application's data persistence capability.
