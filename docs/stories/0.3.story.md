## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 0.2 successfully implemented the complete database layer with SQLite integration, Repository pattern, and comprehensive data access functionality. The database schema, connection management, and all repository classes are fully functional with transaction support and proper error handling. This provides a solid foundation for service layer integration.

### Service Architecture Design
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Service Architecture]

**Service Layer Organization:**
```typescript
src/services/
├── StrategyEngine.ts        # 网格策略引擎
├── PriceMonitor.ts          # 价格监控服务  
├── RiskManager.ts           # 风险管理服务
├── OKXService.ts            # OKX交易服务
├── WalletManager.ts         # 钱包管理服务
└── NotificationService.ts   # 通知服务
```

**Controller Integration Pattern:**
Controllers will use dependency injection to consume these services. Each service must be injectable and follow the established pattern from backend architecture.

### StrategyEngine Service Specifications
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Service Architecture]

**Required Interface Methods:**
- `createStrategy(config: GridStrategyConfig): Promise<GridStrategy>`
- `startStrategy(strategyId: string): Promise<void>`
- `stopStrategy(strategyId: string): Promise<void>`
- `getStrategyStatus(strategyId: string): Promise<StrategyStatus>`
- `validateStrategyConfig(config: GridStrategyConfig): ValidationResult`

**Dependencies:**
- StrategyRepository for data persistence
- RiskManager for strategy validation
- GridCalculator for price level calculations
- Logger for structured logging

### PriceMonitor Service Specifications
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md, architecture/data-models.md]

**Required Interface Methods:**
- `startMonitoring(pairs: string[]): Promise<void>`
- `stopMonitoring(pair?: string): Promise<void>`
- `getCurrentPrice(pair: string): Promise<number>`
- `getPriceHistory(pair: string, timeframe: string): Promise<PriceHistory[]>`
- `subscribeToPrice(pair: string, callback: PriceCallback): void`

**Event Emission Requirements:**
- Must emit price update events for real-time monitoring
- Should cache recent price data in memory for performance
- Integration with IPriceHistory database model for persistence

### RiskManager Service Specifications
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Required Interface Methods:**
- `validateStrategy(config: GridStrategyConfig): Promise<RiskAssessment>`
- `assessCurrentRisk(strategyId: string): Promise<RiskLevel>`
- `checkPositionLimits(strategyId: string, amount: number): Promise<boolean>`
- `evaluateStopLoss(price: number, strategy: GridStrategy): Promise<boolean>`
- `emergencyStop(strategyId?: string): Promise<void>`

**Risk Assessment Criteria:**
- Maximum position ratio validation
- Stop-loss price verification
- Grid parameter validation (price ranges, counts)
- Available balance verification

### OKXService Integration Specifications
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Required Interface Methods:**
- `initialize(config: OKXConfig): Promise<void>`
- `placeOrder(order: OrderRequest): Promise<OrderResult>`
- `cancelOrder(orderId: string): Promise<void>`
- `getBalance(network: string): Promise<Balance>`
- `getOrderStatus(orderId: string): Promise<OrderStatus>`

**Network Support Priority:**
1. Linea (primary for MVP)
2. BNB Chain (secondary)
3. Ethereum (future)
4. Solana (future)

**SDK Integration:**
- Must integrate with OKX DEX SDK (https://github.com/okx/okx-dex-sdk)
- Handle authentication and wallet management
- Implement proper error handling for network failures

### Dependency Injection Configuration
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Controller Template]

**Service Container Pattern:**
```typescript
export class ServiceContainer {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  
  register<T>(name: string, factory: () => T): void
  resolve<T>(name: string): T
  initialize(): Promise<void>
}
```

**Registration Requirements:**
- All services must be registered in the container
- Constructor dependencies must be resolved automatically
- Service initialization order must be managed properly
- Configuration must be injected from config files

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Service implementations: `src/services/*.ts`
- Service interfaces: Include in service files or separate interface files
- Service container: `src/utils/ServiceContainer.ts` or `src/services/ServiceContainer.ts`
- Service configurations: `src/config/services.config.ts`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/*.test.ts`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- TypeScript strict mode with no 'any' types allowed
- All async operations must include comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging with requestId for all service operations
- Constructor dependency injection pattern required
- Configuration management through config objects only
- Rate limiting for external API calls (OKX SDK)
- Memory management for price data caching
- Transaction support for database operations

### Data Model Integration
[Source: src/models/types/database.types.ts]

**Key Interfaces Available:**
- `IGridStrategy`: Complete strategy entity with all required fields
- `IGridOrder`: Order tracking with status lifecycle management
- `ITrade`: Trade history with profit calculations
- `IPriceHistory`: Price data storage for historical analysis
- `IWallet`: Wallet management with encrypted key storage

**Repository Integration:**
Services must use the existing repository classes for data persistence:
- StrategyRepository for strategy CRUD operations
- OrderRepository for order lifecycle management
- TradeRepository for trade history tracking
- ConfigRepository for service configuration storage

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/*.test.ts`
- Service integration tests: `tests/integration/services/*.test.ts`
- Mock implementations: `tests/helpers/mock-*.ts`

**Required Test Coverage:**
- All service methods must have comprehensive unit tests
- Error handling scenarios must be tested
- Dependency injection must be validated
- Integration tests with repository layer required
- Mock OKX SDK for external API testing

**Testing Framework:**
- Vitest for all service testing
- Mock objects for dependency isolation
- Test helpers for common service setup patterns
- Integration test database setup required

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Private key handling through secure WalletManager integration
- No logging of sensitive data (private keys, passwords)
- Input validation using Zod schemas for all service methods
- Rate limiting for external API calls to prevent abuse
- Transaction boundaries for data consistency
- Error messages must not expose internal system details
