# Story 0.6: Test framework and CI/CD foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** to establish a complete testing framework and continuous integration environment,
**so that** we can ensure code quality, automate testing, and streamline the deployment process.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  Configure the Vitest testing framework for the project.
2.  Create the directory structure for unit, integration, and E2E tests as defined in the architecture.
3.  Implement a test database setup and teardown mechanism for integration tests.
4.  Develop mock tools for external services like the OKX API.
5.  Configure a basic GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration that runs on every push.
6.  Generate and configure code coverage reporting.
7.  Create initial test helper utilities and data fixtures.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Configure Vitest (AC: 1)**
  - [x] Install and configure `vitest.config.ts`.
  - [x] Define test-related scripts in `package.json` (e.g., `test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, `coverage`).
- [x] **Task 2: Establish Test Directory Structure (AC: 2)**
  - [x] Create the `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e`, `tests/fixtures`, and `tests/helpers` directories.
  - [x] Add `.gitkeep` files to empty directories to ensure they are committed.
- [x] **Task 3: Implement Test Database Helper (AC: 3)**
  - [x] Create a `DatabaseTestHelper` in `tests/helpers/database-helper.ts`.
  - [x] The helper should manage a separate test database file.
  - [x] It should include methods for `setupTestDatabase`, `resetDatabase`, and `cleanup`.
- [x] **Task 4: Develop Mock Services (AC: 4)**
  - [x] Create a mock OKX client/server in `tests/helpers/mock-okx-client.ts` to simulate API calls.
  - [x] The mock should allow for simulating price updates and trade executions.
- [x] **Task 5: Configure GitHub Actions CI (AC: 5)**
  - [x] Create a `.github/workflows/test.yml` file.
  - [x] The workflow should trigger on `push` to the `main` branch and on pull requests.
  - [x] It should install dependencies, build the project, and run all tests (`npm test`).
- [x] **Task 6: Set Up Code Coverage (AC: 6)**
  - [x] Configure Vitest to generate coverage reports in `lcov` and `text` formats.
  - [x] Ensure coverage reports are saved to the `coverage/` directory.
  - [x] Add `coverage/` to `.gitignore`.
- [x] **Task 7: Create Initial Fixtures and Helpers (AC: 7)**
  - [x] Create example strategy data in `tests/fixtures/strategies.json`.
  - [x] Create a general `test-utils.ts` in `tests/helpers` for common setup/teardown logic.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 0.5 successfully implemented the complete security and encryption infrastructure. While basic tests were run, this story will formalize the entire testing harness, including CI, dedicated helpers, and coverage analysis, which is critical for ensuring the security components remain robust.

### Tech Stack Specifications
*   **Testing Framework**: Vitest (`^1.0.0`) [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]
*   **Build Tool**: `tsc` [Source: `architecture/tech-stack.md`]

### Project Structure for Testing
The entire testing structure should be created under the `tests/` directory, following the detailed layout specified in `architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.

```text
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── repositories/
├── integration/
├── e2e/
├── fixtures/
│   └── strategies.json
└── helpers/
    ├── database-helper.ts
    ├── mock-okx-client.ts
    └── test-utils.ts
```
[Source: `architecture/unified-project-structure.md`]

### Testing Strategy Requirements
*   **Test Organization**: Adhere to the test organization guidelines in `architecture/testing-strategy.md`, separating tests by type (unit, integration, e2e) and domain (backend, cli).
*   **Test Helpers**: The `DatabaseTestHelper` and `OKXMockServer` mentioned in the testing strategy document are key deliverables for this story.
*   **E2E Lifecycle**: The E2E test example (`grid-strategy-lifecycle.test.ts`) provides a clear target for what the testing infrastructure should be able to support.

### Technical Constraints
*   **Test Coverage**: Core trading logic must eventually reach 100% test coverage. This story lays the foundation for measuring and tracking that metric. [Source: `architecture/coding-standards.md`]
*   **CI Workflow**: The GitHub Actions workflow must run `npm install`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` to be considered complete.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of the testing framework and CI/CD foundation is of high quality. The code is well-structured, adheres to the project's architectural guidelines, and provides a solid foundation for future development and testing. The use of Vitest is configured effectively, including coverage thresholds that correctly enforce the 100% coverage requirement for core logic.

### Refactoring Performed
A minor bug was identified and corrected in the mock OKX client.

- **File**: `tests/helpers/mock-okx-client.ts`
  - **Change**: Modified the `updateBalances` method to accept `instId` as a parameter.
  - **Why**: The original implementation incorrectly used the `instId` from the first order in the `openOrders` array, which would cause incorrect balance calculations when multiple orders for different instruments are placed.
  - **How**: By passing the `instId` from the `placeOrder` method, the balance update is now correctly associated with the instrument of the order being processed.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored mock OKX client for correct balance updates.

### Security Review
Not applicable for this foundational story, as no business logic was implemented. The established testing framework will be critical for validating security in future stories.

### Performance Considerations
Not applicable for this foundational story. The testing framework includes a directory for performance tests, which is a good provision for the future.

### Files Modified During Review
- `tests/helpers/mock-okx-client.ts`
